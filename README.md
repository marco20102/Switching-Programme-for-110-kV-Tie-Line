## 📄 About This Application

The Switching-Programme-for-110-kV-Tie-Line is a user-friendly application designed to help you manage and simulate switching operations on 110 kV tie lines. It was created as part of the Week 48 Homework assignment at IT STEP Academy. The programme aims to make high-voltage power system operations easier to understand and safer to perform.

This software uses proven design patterns common in engineering applications. While it is built on technical engineering principles, you do not need any programming skills to use it. The interface guides you to simulate switching steps, reducing mistakes and improving training for engineers.
